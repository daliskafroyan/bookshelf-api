# Description

Final project of Dicoding's course of backend program. We had to create bookshelf CRUD API with Node.js
utilizing hapi.js framework. It's fullfilled all of the test criteria with some
minuscule additions such as :

- VSCode custom code snippets for grouping and tidying up handler's region code. Press ⌘ K + ⌘ 8 to fold all regions
- Prettier for enforcing code's format in par with eslint

In the near future, I planned to update it with :

- Migrate to free-tier hosting : For now I still host it in EC2 AWS trial, but for longterm I would consider use free hosting service such as Heroku to keep this project alive. Using AWS is a bit overengineered tho
- Add Database : Well obviously by adding database, It would save the data in a proper way
- Typescript for writing type-safe code to keep up with industry standard : self explanatory
